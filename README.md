# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science

This repository contains Machine Learning and Data Science exercises and projects created using **Jypter Notebooks** and  **Google Colab Notebooks**.

## Exercises

The exercises are done with the following tools:

* [NumPy](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/NumPy)
* [Pandas](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Pandas)
* [Matplotlib](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Matplotlib)
* [Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Scikit-learn)

## Projects

There are three projects included, which made with all the tools that were used in the exercises:

* [Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Milestone%20Project%201)
    * Made With: Jupyter Notebook
    * Description: This project uses logistic regression to predict the susceptiblilty of a patient to heart disease based on the symptoms that are shown.
    * Dataset: Kaggle

* [Bluebook for Bulldozers](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Milestone%20Project%202)
    * Made With: Jupyter Notebook
    * Description: This project learn from time series data to predict the prices of various bulldozers with regression.
    * Dataset: Kaggle

* [Dog Vision](https://github.com/SwethaVipparla/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/tree/master/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Milestone%20Project%203): 
    * Made With: Google Colab 
    * Description: This project uses transfer learning to identify the breed of a dog from a given picture. 
    * Dataset: UCl
